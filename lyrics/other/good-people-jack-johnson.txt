You win, it's your show now
So what's it gonna be?
Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch?
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad, getting worse

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We've got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that with a rattle attack
Testing, one, two
Man, what you gonna do?
Bad news misused, got too much to lose
Give me some truth now, who's side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube, I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We've got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away, but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great this all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you, it's not important to me
The way down by the edge of your reason
Let's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
Where'd all the good people go?

They got this and that with a rattle attack
Testing one, two
Man, what you gonna do?
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Whose side are we on today, anyway?
Okay, whatever you say
Wrong and resolute, but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone
